Server: Express
OCR: Tesseract
Ingredient Analysis: nothing yet

### What needs to be done:

- conver other image types (.jpg, .gif, .bmp) to .png before they go to fileupload.js. Currently, fileupload.js only takes in .png files

- gather a larger storage of images of ingredient lists for test purposes.

- allow user to upload pictures from their device's camara

- find databases that will give us toxicity, cancer linkage, or legal status in other countries of the ingredients.
